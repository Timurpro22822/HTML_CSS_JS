        <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>ax + b = 0</mark></p>
        <p>where <span class="for-span">a</span> and <span class="for-span">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="for-span">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="for-span">x</span>
            so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="for-span">x</span> there.</p>
        <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark></p>
        <p>where <span class="for-span">a</span>, <span class="for-span">b</span>, <span class="for-span">c</span> are known values and <span class="for-span">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="for-span">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
        <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
        <p> <span class="for-span">π</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="for-span">r</span>) squared:</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>A = π + r<sup>2</sup></mark></p>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="for-span">D</span>):</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>A = (π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></mark></p>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="for-span">C</span>):</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π</mark></p>
        <h4>Intersection</h4>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="for-span">A</span> and <span class="for-span">B</span>, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
        <p class="for-formula"><mark>A [sign] B = { x : × є A and x є B }</mark></p>
        <p>That is, <span class="for-span">x</span> is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if <span class="for-span">x</span> is both an element of <span class="for-span">A</span> and an element of <span class="for-span">B</span>.</p>
